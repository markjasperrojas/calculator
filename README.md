# calculator

I just finished the calculator learning project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This calculator only has basic functions, no design yet, and the code is only about 25% to 40% optimized based on my estimate. You may still see some small bugs, and I will fix them soon.

The hardest part of this project is that using eval() or similar methods is not allowed, so you really need to handle the logic yourself. Using AI is also not allowed. I did not fully polish the code and UI since this is my second time making a calculator.

That’s all for now. I am moving forward to the Full Stack JavaScript path.
